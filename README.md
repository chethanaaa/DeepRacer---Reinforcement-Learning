# DeepRacer---Reinforcement-Learning
Autonomous Racing Optimization

# Deep Reinforcement Learning Project

## Overview
This repository contains an implementation of deep reinforcement learning (RL) techniques applied to a real-world task. The project explores policy optimization, value-based methods and model-free RL techniques to train an intelligent agent. 

## Features
- Implements deep Q-networks (DQN), PPO, SAC and other RL algorithms.
- Uses PyTorch for deep learning-based function approximation.
- Optimizes policy learning and reward shaping for enhanced performance.
- Provides visualization tools for tracking agent learning progress.

## Installation
To set up the environment, run the following:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
Run the training script:

```bash
python train.py --algorithm PPO --env CartPole-v1
```

Evaluate the trained model:

```bash
python evaluate.py --model path_to_saved_model
```

## Dependencies
- Python 3.x
- PyTorch
- OpenAI Gym
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

## Results
The agent learns an optimal policy to maximize rewards in the given environment. Training logs and performance metrics are visualized for easy interpretation.
